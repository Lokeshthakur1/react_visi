With marketing automation, message is tailored to each audience member, making the communication highly personalized. It saves time, energy and money by repurposing existing web content versus reinventing the wheel. It includes email drip campaigns and triggered messages for lifecycle campaigns.</p>

With this data, one can know who DIDN’T value the initiative. And if their email is available, it can be used for some of these other feedback methods to dive deeper into trying to understand why they didn’t think our initiative is valuable. The next step would be to reach out to them directly and try to set up a meeting. Or maybe pull a list of people that have similar patterns of activity and email them a survey.</p>
