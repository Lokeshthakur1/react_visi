                                    <p className="text-justify">The business of computer software has evolved to a usage-based model where revenue is based on a fixed fee earned per licensed User, identified either by a License Key and sometimes augmented by the IP address. Usage is a virtual concept, and lacking methods to physically monitor and identify users, multiple users can use the same license. This pegs down the real number of usages and creates a leakage in the revenue stream.</p>

                                    <p className="text-justify">Revenue Leakage is a widely acknowledged and troublesome phenomenon, especially in service and transaction-based industries. Since the source of the problem is not easily identifiable, companies need the help of analytic ingenuity to identify the sources of leakage, quantifying the volume of revenue loss and prescribing the process for recovery.</p>

                                    <p className="text-justify">Recent years have seen an amazing development in methods to access and unify heterogeneous data from multiple sources, both public and private, and perform data-driven inferential computations to solve hitherto intractable problems.</p>

                                    <p className="text-justify">We present a case-study where the imaginative use of state-of-the-art analytic methods helped one of the biggest providers of licensed software in India identify their revenue leaks, estimate the gap between earned and collected revenue, and act on the information to recover large portion of the supposedly lost earnings. This potential is immense for monitoring and managing revenue leakage, and such gap filling is the biggest potential area of revenue generation. Our present case in investigation is the gift of analytics practice in our neo-modern techno-oriented business.</p>

This information has to be arrived at using special intelligence practice that is based on the logical steps of inferential reasoning.

The a-priori segmentation is more qualitative and this latest one is more quantitative.
