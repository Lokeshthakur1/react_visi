                                    The Drug Discovery mechanisms, including AI, uses technologies that use AI to become
                                    versatile equipment that can be utilized ubiquitously. It can be applied in multiple
                                    drug development levels, such as identification and validation of drug targets,
                                    designing new drugs, drug repurposing, enhancing the R & D efficiency, aggregating, and

                                    diverse streams of biomedical and healthcare data. It can collect and relate
                                    longitudinal electronic medical records, next-generation sequencing, and other data into
                                    mechanistic computer models representing individual patients. AI can design new
                                    molecules and inculcate them in the design-make-test cycle rapidly. It can run the
                                    absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), and toxicity predictions
                                    analysis very rapidly with accurate results. AI can bring together data points obtained
                                    from different studies to the most promising drug candidates. It can also use a deep
                                    convolutional neural network to do structure-based drug design.</p>

                                    interactions in the simplest feature up and full objects. Target-based drug study is
                                    also possible through AI technology. Till now, we were working on one target one
                                    disease. However, the body is a complex structure, and there is a need to see the
                                    complex interactions of various diseases collectively. This is well beyond human
                                    intervention, as there are many parameters to consider. Using AI can help to solve these
                                    issues.
