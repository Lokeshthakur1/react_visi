                                    thing in your business. AI can help you to predict the best for you, monitor your
                                    competition, organise your data, and much more. We are at the edge of the fourth
                                    industrial revolution, and the future is made of AI. </p>
    
                                    <p className="text-justify">The need is to shift the focus away from what technologies are being offered. Instead,
                                    the focus should be on how these technologies are impacting the user cases of
                                    company-specific, along with enhancing their outcomes. AI is seen automating previous
                                    jobs that were done manually and condensing the time-consuming processes. </p>

                                    handling, and handling invoicing and procurement processes can be tedious. No one can
                                    afford to employ a workforce that big. The same is with every IT sub-sector. To stay
                                    ahead of the crossing curve, you must identify the curve. Timing is very crucial here.
                                    You have to identify the curve fast and then work on the tactics to stay ahead. AI is
                                    the key to do all of it.</p>
