                                    predict performance and return with synthesized courses of action and solutions. They
                                    can dispose of the results to the human user for value addition.</p>

                                    conventional business models relied upon and put their energies into advertising their
                                    products to create maximum awareness. These were the customer-centric models. However,
                                    apps, sites, or brands providing a personalized experience are appreciated more by the
                                    customers. This is possible with the introduction of artificial intelligence. The
                                    business models are updating to a customer-centric approach from the product-centric
                                    one. This journey was quite the need of the hour. </p>

                                    can help build business models to increase sales, detect fraud, improve customer
